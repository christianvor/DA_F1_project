## Data Processing steps

- combining the datasets in a meaningful way
- first join would be in _Pre-Race_, _Post_Race_ and _Championship_
- We only need the 10 best drivers since no on else receives points (fastest lap is most often under the top 10)
- dropping unneccessary columns to make it easier to work with
- omitting/filling NAs and missing values

## Research questions to answer

- Who is most likely to win the championship?/ the next race given where we race, which teams and sth else?
- Which team will prevail?
- Fastest lap predictions

## How are we approaching this

Which machine learning algos are we choosing? A tree would make sure for sense.
Maybe a classification of drivers, idk yet how exactly we could approach this.



## TODO and Task distribution
1. Preparing datasets
2. joining the datasets so we can work with them
3. prepare it (NA-treatment, fators etc.)
4. train our models
5. interpret results in a report
6. create presentation
